# Crypto-ML: Intelligent Crypto Investment Platform

## Project Overview
Crypto-ML is an intelligent platform that provides crypto market analysis, investment recommendations, and automated trading capabilities. The platform combines machine learning algorithms with real-time market data to offer both long-term investment advice and short-term trading opportunities.

## Team Structure
- ML Team (1 person): Responsible for all machine learning models, data analysis, and trading algorithms
- Frontend Team: Responsible for user interface and experience
- Backend Team: Responsible for API development, database management, and system architecture

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Backend Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Frontend Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Development Workflow
